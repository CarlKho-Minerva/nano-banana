- [x] **Validation Functions**: Unit tests for all core functionality
- [x] **Flow Simulation**: End-to-end payment flow simulation
- [x] **Manual Checklist**: Step-by-step validation guide

## 🚀 Manual Testing Guide

### Prerequisites
1. Frontend server running: `http://localhost:5174/`
2. Backend server running: `http://localhost:3001/`
3. Browser with developer tools open

### Test Scenarios

#### 🎯 Scenario 1: Basic Image State Preservation
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to the edit page
2. Upload an image (use provided sample images)
3. Make some edits (use retouch tool, add hotspots)
4. Note current state (history, hotspot position, prompt text)
5. Click "Buy 50 Credits ($5)" button
6. **Expected**: Console logs showing image state being saved
7. Allow Stripe redirect to proceed (or press back button)
8. Return to edit page
9. **Expected**: Image and all edit history perfectly restored

#### 🎯 Scenario 2: Payment Cancellation Recovery
**Steps:**
1. Upload image and make edits
2. Initiate credit purchase
3. Cancel payment on Stripe page
4. Return to application  
5. **Expected**: Image state restored with appropriate cancellation message

#### 🎯 Scenario 3: Large Image Handling
**Steps:**
1. Upload a large image (>2MB)
2. Create extensive edit history (multiple operations)
3. Initiate purchase
4. **Expected**: Compression logs in console, successful save despite size

#### 🎯 Scenario 4: Storage Failure Graceful Handling
**Steps:**
1. Open browser dev tools → Application → Storage
2. Fill localStorage to near capacity
3. Attempt credit purchase with complex image state
4. **Expected**: Fallback compression, graceful degradation messages

### 📊 Console Validation Points

**During Purchase (Look for these logs):**
```
📸 Preparing image state for preservation...
💾 Preserving image state before payment redirect...
💾 Saving image state before payment redirect...
📊 Image state size: X.XKB
✅ Image state saved successfully  
🔀 Redirecting to Stripe Checkout...
```

**During Return (Look for these logs):**
```
🎉 Payment success detected: cs_xxxx
💳 Updated credits from backend: XX
🔄 Attempting to restore image state...
✅ Image state restored successfully
🔄 Restoring image state after successful payment...
✅ Image state fully restored
🧹 Image state cleared
```

### 🔍 Browser Testing Script

**Run in browser console on edit page:**
```javascript
// Load test suite
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = '/test-image-preservation.js';
document.head.appendChild(script);

// After script loads, run tests:
testImageStatePreservation();
simulatePaymentFlow();
```

### ✅ Success Criteria

#### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Image visible and editable after payment return
- [ ] Edit history preserved (undo/redo works)
- [ ] Hotspot positions maintained
- [ ] Active tool/tab restored
- [ ] Prompt text preserved
- [ ] Credit count updated correctly

#### User Experience Requirements  
- [ ] No visible loading delays during save/restore
- [ ] Clear success/error messaging
- [ ] Seamless workflow continuation
- [ ] No data loss under any scenario
- [ ] Graceful handling of edge cases

#### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Console logs provide clear debugging info
- [ ] No JavaScript errors during flow
- [ ] Proper memory cleanup
- [ ] Storage limits respected
- [ ] All TypeScript types resolved

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

**If image state is not preserving:**
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify localStorage isn't full
3. Confirm imageStateManager is imported correctly
4. Check network tab for API failures

**If restoration fails:**
1. Look for validation errors in console  
2. Check timestamp expiration (2-hour limit)
3. Verify base64 data integrity
4. Confirm proper cleanup of corrupted data

**If performance is poor:**
1. Monitor compression logs for large images
2. Check storage size calculations
3. Verify proper garbage collection
4. Consider reducing compression quality

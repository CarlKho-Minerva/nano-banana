# 🔒 Cybersecurity Implementation Plan

## Critical Security Issues Identified:

### 🚨 **HIGH PRIORITY - API Key Exposure**
- **Issue**: API key is exposed in client-side code via `VITE_API_KEY`
- **Risk**: Anyone can inspect the source code and steal the API key
- **Impact**: Unauthorized API usage, potential billing abuse

### 🛡️ **Security Measures to Implement**

## 1. API Key Security ⚠️ CRITICAL
- [ ] Move API calls to a backend proxy server
- [ ] Remove `VITE_API_KEY` from client-side code
- [ ] Implement server-side API key handling
- [ ] Add request authentication between frontend and backend

## 2. Input Validation & Sanitization 🧹
- [ ] Validate file uploads (type, size, dimensions)
- [ ] Sanitize user prompts to prevent injection attacks
- [ ] Implement maximum prompt length limits
- [ ] Filter potentially harmful content

## 3. Rate Limiting 🚦
- [ ] Implement client-side request throttling
- [ ] Add server-side rate limiting per IP/user
- [ ] Prevent API abuse and spam attacks
- [ ] Set reasonable usage quotas

## 4. File Upload Security 📁
- [ ] Validate file types (only allow images)
- [ ] Set maximum file size limits (e.g., 10MB)
- [ ] Scan uploaded files for malware
- [ ] Sanitize file names and metadata

## 5. Data Storage Security 💾
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data in localStorage
- [ ] Implement secure session management
- [ ] Add data expiration policies
- [ ] Clear sensitive data on logout

## 6. Additional Hardening 🔧
- [ ] Add Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- [ ] Implement HTTPS-only communication
- [ ] Add error handling without exposing internals
- [ ] Regular security audits and dependency updates

## Implementation Priority:
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix API key exposure
2. **HIGH**: Input validation and file upload security
3. **MEDIUM**: Rate limiting and data storage security
4. **ONGOING**: Additional hardening measures
